NASA Lightweight Hazard Tracking System for JIRA.
====================

The goal of this project is provide Software Assurance Engineers (SWAEs) with a web-based, easy-to-use Hazard Tracking System (HTS) to support hazard analysis and reduce the cost of manually tracking, analyzing, measuring, and managing hazards and hazard reports. 

This system will be a JIRA plug-in. We will focus on clean interfaces and usability, as well as quality and robustness. The plug-ins capabilities will focus on managing hazard data rather than enforcing specific process requirements.
