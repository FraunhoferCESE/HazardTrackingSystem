NASA Lightweight Hazard Tracking System for JIRA
====================

The goal of this project is provide Software Assurance Engineers (SWAEs) with a web-based, easy-to-use Hazard Tracking System (HTS) to support hazard analysis and reduce the cost of manually tracking, analyzing, measuring, and managing hazards and hazard reports. 

This system will be a JIRA plug-in. We will focus on clean interfaces and usability, as well as quality and robustness. The plug-ins capabilities will focus on managing hazard data rather than enforcing specific process requirements.

This project is sponsored by the NASA OSMA Software Assurance Research Program. This software is being developed under the GPLv2 license, with the intention of being released under the NASA Open Source Agreement.
