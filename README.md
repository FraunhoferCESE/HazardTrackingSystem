Lightweight Hazard Tracking System for JIRA
====================

The goal of this project is provide assurance engineers with a web-based, easy-to-use Hazard Tracking System (HTS) to support hazard analysis and reduce the cost of manually tracking, analyzing, measuring, and managing hazards and hazard reports. 

This system will be a JIRA plug-in. We will focus on clean interfaces and usability, as well as quality and robustness. The plug-ins capabilities will focus on managing hazard data rather than enforcing specific process requirements.

This project is sponsored by the NASA OSMA Software Assurance Research Program (http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ivv/research/research_index.html), and is being developed by the Fraunhofer Center for Experimental Software Engineering (http://www.fc-md.umd.edu). This software is being developed under the GPLv2 license.
